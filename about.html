        <p>This company was built for the sole purpose of traveling in space. People supported us as back on Earth, COVID-19 had taken everyone by their throat. It was just a simple company who could make travel to The Moon, but sooner they developed
            to travel to other planets as well. People are very grateful to the founders of the company. Back in 2020 when the company was formed, traveling to Mars was just a dream, but we have sent over thousands of passengers to the Red Planet.</p>
